#Project 05-FPS-Maze
Project for MSCH-C220, 4/9/2021

A simple 3D Maze game where you avoid enemies and collect donuts. Get 5 donuts and find the golden to win.
WASD to move. Q to turn off and on light. Esc for menu while in game. 

## Implementation
Built using Godot 3.2.3
Features:
Red enemy that follows you. Kills you if you get too close. Produce a eerie noise when they spot you.
Donuts that are collectables.
Eerie Background music.
Has main menu, endgame menu, death menu, and in game control menu.
The solid use of geometry is at the beggining with a cube wall and a sphere that removes a hole to walk through.
The map is all dark and you need to use a flash light to figure out where to walk.

Donut made by me.
Menu screen art made by me. Font is Algerian.
